# EarthDeltaVPlanner
## Description
The EarthDeltaVPlanner utilises the Sol System Delta-V Map From Wikipedia Commons Library and assuming burns at periapsis with gravity assist and inclination changes ignored calculates APPROXIMATE DeltaV required to reach different destinations in the Sol System.

### DO NOT USE FOR REAL MISSIONS
This is a fun side project and based on the bellow possibly inaccruate DeltaV map.
Outputs are approximations only, in the unlikely event of someone using this for a real mission, run your own numbers.
Don't believe everything you read online, and over estimate DeltaV required, too much fuel is better then too little.
